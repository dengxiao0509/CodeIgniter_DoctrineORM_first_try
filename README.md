# CodeIgniter_DoctrineORM_first_try
First try, use PHP to create a site

I use the framework CodeIgniter and DoctrineORM to create a "newsborad" by using the language PHP.
We can create news, delete news, and view all the news published. And each news has a title and a content.
There are links between different pages, easy to skip between them.
